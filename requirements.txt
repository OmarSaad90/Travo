#### Founder's Message:
From the very beginning, when I founded Travo International, my vision was simple yet ambitious: to build not only enduring infrastructure but also enduring relationships. Our work was never just about roads, bridges, or marine works—it was about laying the foundations for progress, trust, and shared prosperity.

Like other great family-owned construction enterprises, we built this company on values that outlast projects: integrity, accountability, and a relentless pursuit of excellence. Every contract signed, every project delivered, and every partnership forged has been guided by these principles.

What began as a small regional contractor has grown into an international enterprise that thrives on challenges others may shy away from—whether tunneling through difficult geology, protecting coastlines, or enabling vital energy infrastructure. Through it all, our commitment to safety, quality, and human development has remained uncompromised.

Today, as I look at the next generation of leadership carrying forward our legacy, I see Travo not just as a company but as a family—made up of our dedicated employees, trusted partners, and the communities we serve. Our greatest success is not only in what we have built, but in the trust and respect we have earned.

To our clients, colleagues, and communities: thank you for walking this journey with us. The story of Travo International is a story still being written, and together, we will continue building for generations to come.

**— Simon Karam, Founder, Travo International**
